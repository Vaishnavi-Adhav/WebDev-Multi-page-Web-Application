    <h2>About Snakes and Snake House</h2>

    <div class="about-snakes">

        <p>This website is about snakes and here you can adopt a snake of your choice. Snakes are very useful for human
            beings. Snake, (suborder Serpentes), also called serpent, any of more than 3,400 species
            of reptiles distinguished by their limbless condition and greatly elongated body and tail. Classified with
            lizards in the order Squamata, snakes represent a lizard that, over the course of evolution, has undergone
            structural reduction, simplification, and loss as well as specialization.
            Nearly every culture since prehistoric times (including various present-day cultures) has worshipped,
            revered, or feared snakes.
            Serpent worship is one of the earliest forms of veneration, with some carvings dating to 10,000 BCE.
            Although Satan is depicted as a serpent in the biblical account of the Creation, snakes are revered by most
            societies.
            The number of rattlesnakes used for their skins is minor in comparison. Hundreds of thousands of live snakes
            are collected for sale in the international pet trade. Nearly 100,000 ball pythons and 30,000 boa
            constrictors are imported annually into the United States.This
            dormant period is similar to hibernation in winter by temperate-area snakes, although little is known about
            physiological changes
            that may or may not take place in tropical dormancy. At higher latitudes and altitudes, during periods of
            maximum stress (which for most snakes are the cold months), the animals must seek out a place where
            they can be completely inactive and nonreactive, where their inability to respond to the stimulus of danger
            is compensated for by the absence of danger, and where
            the surrounding extremes of low temperature and low humidity remain within tolerable limits.

        </p>

        <p>Cobra, any of various species of highly venomous snakes, most of which expand the neck ribs to form a hood.
            While the hood
            is characteristic of cobras, not all of them are closely related. Cobras are found from southern
            Africa through southern Asia to islands of Southeast Asia.A vast global compendium of superstitions and
            mythologies
            about snakes has sprung up. Many stem from the snakes’ biological peculiarities: their ability to shed their
            skin
            is associated with immortality; their ever-open eyes represent omniscience; their propensity for sudden
            appearance and
            disappearance allies snakes with magic and ghosts; a phallic resemblance embodies
            procreative powers; and the ability to kill with a single bite engenders fear of any snakelike creature.At
            higher latitudes and altitudes, during periods of maximum stress (which for most snakes are the cold
            months), the animals must seek out a place where they can
            be completely inactive and nonreactive, where their inability to respond to the stimulus of danger is
            compensated for
            by the absence of danger, and where the surrounding extremes of low temperature and low humidity remain
            within tolerable limits.The removal
            of such enormous numbers from the wild threatens the survival of these species, and many snake populations
            are in decline
            as a result of capture and habitat destruction.
            The release of nonnative pet snakes into the wild has also led to the introduction of several invasive
            species,
            including the Burmese pythons that have devastated small mammal populations in the Florida Everglades.This
            dormant period is similar to hibernation in winter by temperate-area snakes, although little is known about
            physiological changes
            that may or may not take place in tropical dormancy.

        <p>King snake any of a group of moderate-sized to large terrestrial snakes found from southeastern
            Canada to Ecuador. Adults generally range in length from 1 to 1.5 metres (3.3 to 5 feet), but some have
            grown to 2.1 metres (6.8 feet).
            They are nonvenomous constrictors and have a cosmopolitan diet that includes small mammals, birds, snakes,
            lizards, amphibians, and bird eggs.
            Indigo snake, (Drymarchon corais),NSBP docile, nonvenomous member of the famil NSBP Colubrida NSBP found
            from the southeastern United States to Brazil.At higher latitudes and altitudes, during periods
            of maximum stress (which for most snakes are the cold months), the animals must seek out a place where they
            can be
            completely inactive and nonreactive, where their inability to respond to the stimulus of danger is
            compensated for by the absence of danger, and where
            the surrounding extremes of low temperature and low humidity remain within tolerable limits. It is the
            largest snakes in the United States—record
            length is 2.6 metres (8.5 feet)—and one of the largest of all colubrids.In the tropics, life continues at
            approximately the same activity
            level throughout the year. The only break in the rhythm comes in the dry season—and this only when the dry
            season is not
            just a period of slightly less rainfall. At such times, snakes may enter a short period of dormancy,
            which is at least in part a consequence of the effect that the dry season has upon their prey.
